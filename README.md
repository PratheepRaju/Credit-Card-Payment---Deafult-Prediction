# Credit-Card-Payment---Deafult-Prediction

This project aims at developing a classification model to predict payment default of Taiwanese credit clients using their financial records spanning over 6 months (April 2005 - September 2005) consisting of over 25 financial credit card metrics.

I have used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and a boosted version of theese algorithms.  I have also used ensemble models( AdaBoost, XGBoost, GradientBoosting) to check how they perform on this dataset.
